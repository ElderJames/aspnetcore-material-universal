        <p>Angular Ivy change detection execution: are you prepared?</p>
        <p>Letâ€™s see what Angular cooks for us</p>
        <p>While new Ivy renderer is not feature completely yet, many people wonder how it will work and what changes it prepares
            for us.
        </p>
        <p>In this article I am going to visualize Ivy change detection mechanism, show some things I am really excited about
            and also build simple app based on instructions, similar to angular Ivy instructions, from scratch.</p>

        <p>First, letâ€™s introduce the app Iâ€™m going to investigate here:</p>

        </p>
        <p>I created online demo that I use to understand how it works under the hood:

        </p>

        <p>The demo uses angular 6.0.1 aot compiler. You can click on any lifecycle block to go to the definition.</p>

        <p>In order to run change detection process just type something in one of those inputs that are below Sub-Child.</p>
